    StampTypeA: 200
    StampTypeB: 150
    ```
    This will add 200 of `StampTypeA` and 150 of `StampTypeB` to the stamp inventory.

- **Response:**  
    The bot will confirm the additions like:
    ```
    Stamp Addition Results:

#### **`/inventory`**
- **Description:** Shows the current inventory.

- **Response:**  
    The bot will show the envelope and stamp remaining like:
    ```
    Inventory:
    EnvelopeType1: 33
    EnvelopeType2: 92
    EnvelopeType3: 27
    EnvelopeType4: 0

    Stamp:
    StampTypeA: 93
    ```
---

#### **`/add-prices`**
- **Description:** Adds a new price entry. You must provide the stamp/envelope type and UNIT price in the format: `<item>: <price>`. If an item doesn't exist, it will be created.
- **Input:**  
    Example:
    ```
    /add-prices
    ExistingStampTypeA: 0.50
    NewStampTypeB: 0.30
    ExistingEnvelopeA: 0.31
    ExistingEnvelopeB: 9.94
    ```
    This will add a new item `NewStampTypeB` and update `StampTypeA`, `EnvelopeA`, `EnvelopeB` to the price json.

- **Response:**  
    The bot will confirm the additions like:
    ```
    Price Updates:

#### **`/buy`**
- **Description:** Calculates the total price for purchasing. You must provide the item and quantity in the format: `<item>: <quantity>`. If an item doesn't exist, it will be ignored.
- **Input:**  
    Example:
    ```
    /buy
    TMP-C5: 38
    Express: 44
    TMP-Large: 38
    FakeEnvelope: 98
    Satchel: 6
    Parcel-Medium: 3
    ```
    This will add 200 of `StampTypeA` and 150 of `StampTypeB` to the stamp inventory.

- **Response:**  
    The bot will calculate the price like:
    ```
    Purchase Summary:
    TMP-C5: 38 * 5.7 = 216.60
    Express: 44 * 8 = 352.00
    TMP-Large: 38 * 7.3 = 277.40
    FakeEnvelope: Not found
    Satchel: 6 * 9.41 = 56.46
    Parcel-Medium: 3 * 0.21 = 0.63
    Total: 903.09
    ```

---

#### **`/prices`**
- **Description:** Shows the current price list.

- **Response:**  
    The bot will show the envelope and stamp prices like:
    ```
    150c: 1.50
    TMP-Small: 5
    TMP-C5: 6
    TMP-Large: 8
    Express: 9
    Satchel: 10
    Parcel-Medium: 2
    Parcel-ExLarge: 3.5
    Small: 0.8
    ```
---


### **Usage Tracking**

#### **`/estimated-usage`**
- **Description:** Tracks and calculates the usage of envelopes and stamps. You must provide the envelope type and the number of envelopes used in the format: `<envelope_type>: <quantity>`. The bot will calculate how many stamps are needed for the specified number of envelopes and update both the envelope and stamp inventory.
- **Input:**  
    Example:
    ```
    /estimated-usage
    EnvelopeType1: 10
    EnvelopeType2: 5
    ```
    This will calculate the usage of 10 `EnvelopeType1` and 5 `EnvelopeType2` envelopes, and it will check how many stamps are needed for these quantities based on predefined stamp requirements.

- **Response:**  
    The bot will display a detailed response like:
    ```
    Inventory Changes:
    EnvelopeType1: Updated balance to 40
    EnvelopeType2: Updated balance to 95

    Stamp Changes:
    StampTypeA: 100 used for EnvelopeType1
    StampTypeB: 50 used for EnvelopeType2
    ```

---

### **Automated Label Matching**

#### **`/ocr-reference`**
- **Description:** Allows the upload of a single label information csv to match since the label printing is NOT always reliable. This ensures that the OCR result will only output what we printed. This is optional, so if this command is not run, OCR will still work as usual, just with 0% confidence at all times due to missing reference.
- **Input:**  
    Example:
    ```
    /ocr-reference
    ```
    This command will make the bot prompt for a CSV file. Please make sure the subsequent message is a `.csv`. If it is rejected, redo the command. Also please make sure there is NO caption under the file when uploading it to the bot. 

#### **`/ocr-start`**
- **Description:** This command will instruct the bot to start listening to images. Otherwise it will ignore. Each successful image upload will have OCR done, and immediately returned in the bot response. If matched with reference, it will return the label ROW in the reference excel while appending the matched row to the result csv, else, it will return whatever it read from the label for manual intervention. This is all in accordance to the CONFIDENCE output by the matching algorithm (as of time of writing, 75% confidence is automatically entered into result csv)
- **Input:**  
    Example:
    Once OCR has started and an image is detected...

- **Response:**  
    The bot will display a detailed response like:
    - Met threshold
    ```
    Matched Row:
    23-12534-78169, Mark Wright, 9 Wright Av., Sheraton, VIC, 3630, [SP]/[C5] Z3-06-09 x1, 1
    Confidence: 84.93%
    ```
    
    - Failed to meet threshold:
    ```
    Matched Row with Low Confidence value, Review required:
    C-123817-A, John Cena, Deep Sea Ave., Bilgewater, FIS, 8312, [NG]/[C4] A1-10-12 x4, 1
    Confidence: 60.87%
    ```
    
    - No reference:
    ```
    No reference data available. Please upload reference data.
    Read label:
    george washington
    3200 Mount Vernon Memorial Highway, Mount Vernon, Virginia, 22121
    [SP]/[TMP-C5] D0-02-07 *1
    Confidence: 0%
    ```

#### **`/ocr-end`**
- **Description:** Collects all the recognized labels that are ABOVE threshold into a single csv for ease of moving into sheets, and stops the bot from listening to images.
- **Input:**  
    Example:
    ```
    /ocr-end
    ```
    The bot will send the final collected `ocr_results.csv` and end listening to images.

## How It Works
1. **Inventory Setup:**  
   Use `/add-envelopes` and `/add-stamps` to populate your inventory with envelope types and stamp types.
   
2. **Track Usage:**  
   Record the usage of envelopes and stamps by using the `/estimated-usage` command. The bot will calculate the necessary stamp usage and update the inventory.
   
3. **Group Management:**  
   Use `/list-groups` and `/register` to manage which groups the bot interacts with. Only registered groups can execute restricted commands like `/add-envelopes` and `/estimated-usage`.

4. **Monitoring:**  
   Use `/list-registered` to view all registered groups, and monitor changes in the inventory in real-time.

---

## Notes
- The bot will only respond to commands from registered groups for commands like `/add-envelopes`, `/estimated-usage`, etc.
- Ensure correct input formats, such as providing envelope types and quantities, to avoid errors.
- You must register a group before it can use the bot for specific commands. Use `/list-groups` to get the list of groups and `/register` to enable a group. (p/s: you can send these commands to yourself because any unregistered group message will be ignored)

For any issues or feedback, contact the bot administrator.

Happy Grinding!
