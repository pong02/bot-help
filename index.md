### **Usage Tracking**

#### **`/estimated-usage`**
- **Description:** Tracks and calculates the usage of envelopes and stamps. You must provide the envelope type and the number of envelopes used in the format: `<envelope_type>: <quantity>`. The bot will calculate how many stamps are needed for the specified number of envelopes and update both the envelope and stamp inventory.
- **Input:**  
    Example:
    ```
    /estimated-usage
    EnvelopeType1: 10
    EnvelopeType2: 5
    ```
    This will calculate the usage of 10 `EnvelopeType1` and 5 `EnvelopeType2` envelopes, and it will check how many stamps are needed for these quantities based on predefined stamp requirements.

- **Response:**  
    The bot will display a detailed response like:
    ```
    Inventory Changes:
    EnvelopeType1: Updated balance to 40
    EnvelopeType2: Updated balance to 95

    Stamp Changes:
    StampTypeA: 100 used for EnvelopeType1
    StampTypeB: 50 used for EnvelopeType2
    ```

---

## How It Works
1. **Inventory Setup:**  
   Use `/add-envelopes` and `/add-stamps` to populate your inventory with envelope types and stamp types.
   
2. **Track Usage:**  
   Record the usage of envelopes and stamps by using the `/estimated-usage` command. The bot will calculate the necessary stamp usage and update the inventory.
   
3. **Group Management:**  
   Use `/list-groups` and `/register` to manage which groups the bot interacts with. Only registered groups can execute restricted commands like `/add-envelopes` and `/estimated-usage`.

4. **Monitoring:**  
   Use `/list-registered` to view all registered groups, and monitor changes in the inventory in real-time.

---

## Notes
- The bot will only respond to commands from registered groups for commands like `/add-envelopes`, `/estimated-usage`, etc.
- Ensure correct input formats, such as providing envelope types and quantities, to avoid errors.
- You must register a group before it can use the bot for specific commands. Use `/list-groups` to get the list of groups and `/register` to enable a group.

For any issues or feedback, contact the bot administrator.

Happy managing!
